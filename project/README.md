# Mobile-first Website Project
Put your html and css files in here.

## Goal:
Students will code and design an image gallery project that contains a minimum of 9 related thumbnail-sized images that when clicked open up a full-sized version of those images. The design of the layout should be a grid of images that are styled using fonts, colors, borders, and other styles.

## Requirements
### Folder and file structure requirements
* The home page is named `index.html`
* Images should be stored in the `images` (all lowercase letters)
* Project contains at least 4 `HTML` documents

### HTML requirements
* 1 or more stylesheets (a style tag can count) - but *no style attributes* in any HTML tag.
* Each html document contains all standard HTML5 required tags (`DOCTYPE`, `html`, `head`, `title`, `body`) 
    - ***NOTE: only one of each tag should appear in each document.***
* Each HTML document follows semantic tags and structure employing these elements: `header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, and `footer`
* A `header` element (in each page) contains your title (using the `h1` tag)
* Only 1 `main` element per page (NOTE: if you have more than one `main`, it will trigger a validation error).
* Each page needs to include multiple sections (could be `div`, `section`, or `article`) in the main element that divides up the topic and includes some info from each section as a way to highlight the content.
* Each page should have at least *5 paragraphs* 
* There should be at least *three lists in all* and at least *3 list items per list* (for the entire project)
* Each page should have at least *2 images (each in a figure tag)*.
* Navbars should each link to the pages in your project using a relative link.
* has no HTML errors

### CSS Requirements
* A font pairing.
* Background color set on the page and at least 1 other color set for text.
* Any color or background color set on an element passes the AIM color contrast checker
    - Must pass at a AAA rating for any non-heading
    - May pass at a AA rating for headings
* The container uses the `flex` property and related flex properties to contribute to the layout.
* The figures are styled using the `margin`, `border`, `padding`, and `background-color` properties

### Design Requirements
* Content must be visible and readable (with high contrast)
* Images are all related in some way (through topic or theme)
* Fonts, colors, and any other styling is consistent with the theme of the images
* Layout is fluid and works on any browser/viewport width

### Assignment Submission Requirements
* Student must commit and push their changes to the repo (repo has the latest work)
* Layout should not look broken at any width
* No horizontal scrollbars should appear unless the window is more narrow that a single figure
* Student must record their image gallery at various viewport widths (or zoom levels) - best will go towards a video showing the browser being set to different screen widths.
